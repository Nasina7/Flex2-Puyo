change sprite scroll speed
drawing mode fill !
S - scroll to sprite
s3k sonic mapping definition / conversion tools
create new file | newFactory={(path)=>{}}
04:43:53 <%Lil-G> i mean so when you do "delete unused tiles" it doesn't delete the tiles the other object uses
==

do animations as a new tab - animation editor - load one at a time and FE changes the current index
animation: play, pause
migration function to add a tab
actually deprecate SonMapEd - due to confusion with handling older formats (maybe add this to the docs)

use 'sonic'; as custom mapping directive

art offset loading / arbitrary data loader tab
firebase for stats

17:27:19 <%MainMemory> do you think you could add an option to export a sprite sheet in the future?
17:28:38 <%MainMemory> as much as I like people using my programs, it would be more convenient if they didn't have to set up a separate project file just to use SpriteSheetGen
17:17:46 <%MainMemory> I think you'll have to change the definition format
17:18:01 <%snkenjoi> why
17:19:20 <%snkenjoi> I just needs extending if anything
17:19:34 <%MainMemory> well I consider that a change to the format
17:20:19 <%snkenjoi> well yeah, it is
17:20:36 <%MainMemory> S1 and S2 DPLC header is number of requests, S3K non-player DPLC header is number of requests minus one
17:20:47 <%snkenjoi> I think it already supports N-1 and N
17:20:52 <%snkenjoi> you just need to use a different letter
17:22:01 <%MainMemory> I'm talking about headerSize(2)
17:22:54 <%MainMemory> you need to be able to add one when reading and subtract one when writing
17:23:04 <%snkenjoi> ah, to the header
17:23:08 <%MainMemory> instead of just writing the entry count as-is
17:23:17 <%snkenjoi> header(2, -1) would work
17:23:23 <%snkenjoi> I mean
17:23:25 <%snkenjoi> not atm
17:23:29 <%snkenjoi> when I support it
17:23:29 <%snkenjoi> lol
17:23:35 <%MainMemory> sure
17:23:43 <%snkenjoi> or headerMutation(-1)
17:23:48 <%snkenjoi> as an addition
17:24:20 <%MainMemory> and the rest is just swapping the order of the N and A lines
17:24:28 <%snkenjoi> yeah which it already supports

17:47:50 <MainMemory> if you're interested, you can set a webhook in the repository settings with a URL like http://mmbot.reimuhakurei.net/github?key=secrethackingtools&network=BadnikZONE&channel=%23SSRG
