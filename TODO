21:08 <+dIRCord> <Râ€‹andomName> Not this. For example look at ArtScaled_EggRoboFly, which is art that's used by s3k art scaler. It's uncompressed art,tho it looks transformed in some way, but not like random mess of pixels.
uses a grayscale copy of another frame that you selected separately from the current one as a "background" frame.
drawing mode fill !
S - scroll to sprite

backdrop-filter
Support MainMemory's macros formats
