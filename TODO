Support MainMemory's macros formats
<Hitaxas> There is also a glitch where Flex will sometimes destroy mappings when saving. Unsure the cause, but this has happened to me twice in the past month. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/718373949368696892/731396915052412958/unknown.png

21:10 <+Dick-Cord> <Aâ€‹kumaYin> Being able to load and edit files without using the project setup would be nice. That's one of the few things that I prefer about the original Flex, along with the ability to preview animations.
do animations as a new tab - animation editor - load one at a time and FE changes the current index
animation: play, pause

art offset loading / arbitrary data loader tab
