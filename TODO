ROADMAP
look at issues related to crashes
rotsprite
improve undo/redo when drawing pixels / moving things
animation editor
    export to gif

BUGS

saving 0 tile as nemesis crashes
saving ArtC42 at all crashes
pink surrounding tiles sometimes breaks

FEATURES
set colour of art tiles
make decompression threaded
ctrl+wheel for horiz scroll

ROTSPRITE
rotsprite https://crates.io/crates/rotsprite
https://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?threads/sprite-rotation-utility.8848/#post-159754
==
select multiple sprites at once to reorder
copy / paste mappings
time travel for undo/redo
import palette from spritesheet https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/node-vibrant

22:04 <+dIRCord> <M​ainMemory> > Art is easy ␤> Each byte encodes one pixel, both nybbles have the color index ␤> And then each column is stored all in one go, no breaking into tiles ␤> In other words, it's pretty much a headerless 8bpp bitmap ␤> I think the color index is duplicated over both nybbles for speed, but I never looked at the algorithm
21:08 <+dIRCord> <R​andomName> Not this. For example look at ArtScaled_EggRoboFly, which is art that's used by s3k art scaler. It's uncompressed art,tho it looks transformed in some way, but not like random mess of pixels.
uses a grayscale copy of another frame that you selected separately from the current one as a "background" frame.
drawing mode fill !
S - scroll to sprite
04:43:53 <%Lil-G> i mean so when you do "delete unused tiles" it doesn't delete the tiles the other object uses
backdrop-filter
Support MainMemory's macros formats
<Hitaxas> There is also a glitch where Flex will sometimes destroy mappings when saving. Unsure the cause, but this has happened to me twice in the past month. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/718373949368696892/731396915052412958/unknown.png
